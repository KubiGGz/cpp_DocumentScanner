# cpp_DocumentScanner
### The main problem of this project is an unknown for me dependence of image size and "memory out of bounds" error. Unfortunatelly I didn't catch how to eliminate it :^(
### In some cases we can achieve a correct scaning by setting another parameters (for each image) in getContoursImg() and preProcessinrgImg(), but mostly It doesn't work properly for ANY paper.
